Code Description
The two main scripts used to produce Figures 6, 9, and 10 from the manuscript are titled 'runSimulation.m' and 'compositeFigure.m'. Namely, 'runSimulation.m' is used to generate Figures 6 and 9, while 'compositeFigure.m' is used to generate Figure 10. To get started using the main scripts, read the comments in the section of code titled, "Start here - User Inputs" for a description of each of the variables.

Fascicle 2 is the smaller fascicle in Figure 6, Fascicle 3 is the larger fascicle in Figure 6, and Fascicle 7 (as well as its sub-fascicles 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3) is the fascicle in Figure 9. The whole Fascicle 7 is also used to produce Figure 10. 

An empty folder named, 'HAPI Figures', is in the current folder, and this is the default location where the figures will be saved.
