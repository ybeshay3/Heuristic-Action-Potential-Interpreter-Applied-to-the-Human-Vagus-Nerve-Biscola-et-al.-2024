To get started, open runSimulationScript.m file. This script allows you to test 3 different fascicles from the human vagus nerve. In the User Input section, read the commented description for each of the variables. 

To save the figures produced by runSimulationScript.m script, put that folder (empty or not) in the same folder as the runSimulationScript.m. Then, write the name of the folder as a string in the variable named "folderName" under User Inputs. 

An empty folder named, 'HAPI Figures', is in the current folder, and it is the default location where the figures will be saved.
